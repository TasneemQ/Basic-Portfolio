      <p>At forty-eight, after raising two beautiful children, I decided to get back into the workforce. Having made a few websites in the past, I remembered how much I enjoyed the work and decided to embark on a fast pace course, that, if successful, could help me bridge my knowledge base to become competitive.</p>
      <p>I am presently working my way through KU's Coding Bootcamp which teaches full-stack web development. On completion of the course, I will have a working knowledge of all the tools needed to jump straight into a front or back end web development career.</p>
